        <h2>About Kurmura Ladoo</h2>
        <p>Kurmura Ladoo or Puffed rice ladoo is a toothsome dessert which is highly popular in North India. These delicious ladoos are made 
            by Punjabis specially at the time of Lohri. The easy-to-make ladoos are made with just three simple ingredients which are puffed rice
             (kurmura), ghee, and cane sugar (jaggery). Apart from festivals, these ladoos can be served in pot lucks, game nights, and kitty
              parties. The crispy ladoos are also known as Murmura Ladoos and can be enjoyed both as a dessert and a snack.
