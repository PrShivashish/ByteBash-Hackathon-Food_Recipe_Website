                    <dt><span class="step">Step-1 : </span>Wash and boil the spinach for Palak Paneer</dt>
                    <dd>To make the paneer soft, soak it in water for some time. Cut the paneer into small cubes and keep it aside. To ensure that the spinach is adulterant-free, soak it in water and add a small pinch of salt. Then clean and wash spinach thoroughly. Now, put a deep-bottomed pan over medium flame and add spinach in it. Cover and cook until the spinach becomes soft and mushy. You need not add any water as spinach gets cooked in its own water. Once cooked, take 100 grams of spinach and chop it well in a bowl. Afterwards, puree the remaining spinach and keep it aside. 
                        (Note: You can blanch the spinach as well.

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>For making Palak Paneer at home, use fresh spinach leaves instead of blanched ones. It has more nutrients than the one which is blanched.</li>
                    <li>To maintain that green colour of your Palak Paneer, make sure you use a little less garam masala powder as it brings a little brown colour to any dish.</li>
                    <li>Always soak the store-bought paneer for 20-30 minutes in warm water.</li>
                </ul>
