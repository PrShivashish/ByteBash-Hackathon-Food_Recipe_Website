        <h2 class="proced">Steps to make Chilli Chicken</h2>
        <dl>
           <dt><span class="step">Step-1 : </span>Wash the chicken and prepare the marinade</dt> 
           <dd>To make this delicious recipe, begin with washing the chicken in some lukewarm water 
            and rinse it again in cold water. Then take a large bowl and combine chicken, eggs, 
            ginger-garlic paste and cornflour in it. Mix all the ingredients properly. You can also 
            drizzle a little water to the batter to coat the chicken pieces evenly. Once done, refrigerate the
             chicken for 1-2 hours.</dd><hr>
            <dt><span class="step">Step-2 : </span>Prepare the chilli chicken masala</dt>
            <dd>After 1-2 hours, take out the marinade. Next, heat oil in a deep pan over a high flame. 
                Carefully place the chicken pieces in the oil until cooked through. Remove and drain excess oil 
                on absorbent paper. Meanwhile, heat 1 or 2 tbsps of oil in a separate pan over medium flame. Once 
                the oil is sufficiently hot, add the onions and fry for 2-3 minutes till they turn translucent. Then
                 add the capsicum and green chillies and mix well again. You can also add some dry roasted green 
                 chillies to accentuate the taste.</dd><hr>
            <dt><span class="step">Step-3 : </span>Cook chicken in soya sauce and vinegar</dt>
            <dd>When the veggies are partially cooked, add soy sauce, vinegar, chicken and salt. Mix all the
                 ingredients well and make sure that the chicken is well coated in the sauces. Keep stirring so
                 that the chicken does not stick to the pan.</dd><hr>
            <dt><span class="step">Step-4 : </span>Toss the chilli chicken and serve hot</dt>  
            <dd>Once done, remove and transfer the dish to a bowl. Garnish with the spring onions and roasted
                 sesame seeds (optional) and serve it to your family and friends. We are sure your loved ones
                  will love this awesome recipe. </dd>

        <h2>TIPS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are going to make boneless chilli chicken at home, try using chicken breasts as they are easy to chop.</li>
                <li>For making restaurant-like chilli chicken, dip the chilli chicken in the cornflour batter. This will make them crispy as well as more appealing.</li>
                <li>The brining solution can be made by mixing 2 tbsp yoghurt, 1 pinch salt and 1 ½ cup of water. Soak the chopped chicken for an hour and 
                    refrigerate overnight or for 6-7 hours.</li>
                <li>For that perfect restaurant-like colour of chilli chicken, use Kashmiri red chilli powder or degi mirch. This will add a vibrant colour without making it too spicy.</li>
