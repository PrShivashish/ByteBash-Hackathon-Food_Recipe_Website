                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homemade paneer works best for this recipe. If you are using store-bought paneer, try to soak it in warm water for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If you have more time, add 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes in the first step and then blend the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Strain and blend the residue again in the blender while preparing the gravy for enhanced smoothness.</li>
                    <li>If you prefer a spicier gravy, add 2 tsp green chilli paste or extra red chilli powder.</li>
                </ul>
