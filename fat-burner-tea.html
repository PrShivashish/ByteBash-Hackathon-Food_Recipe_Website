        <h2>What is Burner Tea</h2>
        <p>If you are looking to lose some extra inches, here's the easiest way to do it at home.
             All you need to do is just boil some cumin seeds and cinnamon sticks in water and make it a nice tea. 
             This tea can be a lot to take in as the taste can be quite bitter. Thus, it is best enjoyed with some honey. 
             Cumin seeds are known to be super-healthy and can help boost your metabolism levels, which can, in turn, promote weight loss.
              It also helps in lowering cholesterol levels.
