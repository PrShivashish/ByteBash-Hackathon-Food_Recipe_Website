                    <dd>To begin this recipe, wash cauliflower under running water and break them into florets. Then take a pan and pour some water, and add the cauliflower florets with a dash of salt, partially boil the florets and drain the excess water. 
                        Keep the florets aside.

                    <dt><span class="step">Step-2 : </span>Make the batter</dt>
                    <dd>Take another bowl, add the gram flour (besan), salt, 1 teaspoon oil, turmeric, red chili powder, dry mango powder, baking soda, mix all the ingredients together and gradually add water. Keep stirring so that the batter doesn't form lumps. 
                        Do not add too much water as the batter should not be too thin or too thick.
                    </dd><hr>
                    <dt><span class="step">Step-3 : </span>Deep fry the pakoda</dt>
                    <dd>Put a kadhai on medium flame and add oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, dip each piece of the cauliflower in this batter and fry them in the kadhai, until they turn golden brown in colour. Take out the pakoda on a 
                        plate covered with tissue paper and serve hot with chutney and ketchup.

                <h2>Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you don't over cook the florets of cauliflower else it will spoil the texture of the dish.</li>
                    <li>You can also add some ajwain to the batter, this prevents bloating.</li>
                    <li>You can also add some chopped coriander leaves to accentuate the taste.</li>
