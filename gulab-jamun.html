        Procedure
    </h2>
<dl>
    <dt><span class=step>Step-1 :</span> Prepare the sugar syrup
    </dt>
    <dd>To make this simple Gulab jamun recipe, you need to take a vessel and add sugar, water
         and a slice of lemon. Mix the sugar syrup well and reduce the consistency to two-string. Then turn off the 
         flame and let it attain normal room temperature.
 </dd>
 <dt><span class=step>Step-2 : </span>Make the dough for Gulab Jamun
</dt>
<dd>Take a wide tray and add equal proportions of chenna or paneer and khoya, mash them together using a masher. To accentuate the taste add
     some saffron strands. Make sure that there are no lumps in the mixture. Once the mixture is smooth enough, move on to the next step.
      Mix, all-purpose flour, cardamom powder, cornflour and baking powder in the khoya-paneer mixture. To make the gulab jamun more delicious,
       add some ghee to the mix. This will leave a nice aroma and give it an authentic taste.
</dd>
<dt><span class=step>Step-3: </span>Shape the dough in small balls
</dt>
<dd>Now, rub some ghee in your palms and take some dough and shape them into small balls. In the meantime, put a kadhai over medium flame 
    and heat oil for frying. Once the oil is hot enough, slowly slide the balls and let them cook. Wait till the balls turn golden brown in colour.
</dd>
<dt><span class=step>Step-4 :</span>Soak the fried balls in Gulab Jamun
</dt>
<dd>Take out the balls and remove the excess oil, then gently leave the gulab
     jamun balls in the sugar syrup. Let the Gulab Jamuns absorb the syrup. After half an hour, 
     extract them and place them in a bowl and gently pour some sugar syrup.

</dd>
<dt><span class=step>Step-5 :</span> Garnish with dry fruits
</dt>
<dd>Last, but not the least, garnish the gulab jamuns with some finely chopped pistachios. Serve these gulab jamuns after an elaborate
     and we are sure your guests will praise your culinary skills.

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can use milk powder as well for making delicious Gulab Jamuns. When using it, make sure you grease your
             fingers for making small balls of the dough.

        </li>
        <li>
            Also, don't get confused between baking soda and powder. If you use baking soda, then the Gulab Jamuns 
            will break easily even while frying.

        </li>
        <li>
            To obtain the black-coloured Gulab Jamun, fry them for a little longer than usual on medium low flame.

        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure that the Gulab Jamun dough is as smooth as you can imagine. There should not be a single crack in the ball,
             else the Gulab Jamun will break easily.
