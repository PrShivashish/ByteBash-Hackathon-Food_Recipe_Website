        <dt><span class=step>Step-1 : </span>Grind the almonds</dt>
    <dd>To prepare this delicious treat, start by taking a pan over medium flame and boil water in it. Then, add almonds to it and boil
         them for at least one minute. Now, quickly strain the water and wash the almonds with cold water. The skin of the almonds will start 
         to come off, so peel them off completely. Set the almonds in a grinder and grind them well.

    <dt><span class=step>Step-2 :</span> Heat the pan
    </dt>
    <dd>Next, take another pan and heat it over medium flame. Add the pistachios to the pan and toast them by stirring and tossing them around. 
        Then, take the toasted pistachios and crush them into small pieces.

    <dd>Now, take a large bowl and add the ground almonds with condensed milk and cream in it. Blend them all together and then add the milk 
        along with saffron in it. Blend it well again before adding the pistachios.
    </dd>
    <dt><span class=step>Step-4 :</span>Pour in the molds and refrigerate</dt>
