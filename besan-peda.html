            <li>1/4 cup milk powder            </li>
            <li>1 cup milk            </li>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><span class=step> Step-1 : </span> Roast besan in ghee</dt>
            <dd>Heat 1/4 cup ghee in a pan. Once the ghee melts, add besan to it. Stir and roast the besan on low flame.
                 Keep stirring to prevent it from burning. After 15 minutes, the mixture will turn aromatic and crumbly. Add
                  1 tbsp ghee and again give a good mix. Within the next 2-3 minutes, the mixture will release ghee and become smoother
                   and golden brown in colour.

            </dd>
            <dt><span class=step>Step-2 :</span>Add milk powder and coconut</dt>
            <dd>Now add milk powder and grated coconut to the pan. Mix to combine the ingredients in the besan mixture.
                 Stir continuously and roast for two more minutes. The mixture will again turn a bit crumbly.

            </dd>
            <dt><span class=step>Step-3 :</span>Mix in milk</dt>
            <dd>Now pour milk into the pan and give a whisk. Break all the lumps to make a smooth mixture. Stir continuously and roast for
                 2-3 minutes more. By now the mixture will absorb the milk and leave the sides of the pan. The mixture will also hold shape 
                 at this point.

            </dd>
            <dt><span class=step>Step-4 :</span>Add powdered sugar
            </dt>
            <dd>Now add powdered sugar to the pan and mix till it dissolves completely. Add 1-2 tbsp ghee as well. Mash and cook for 4-5 minutes 
                more. The mixture will now be super soft and glossy. Now switch off the flame.

            </dd>
            <dt><span class=step>Step-5 :</span> Make pedas
            </dt>
            <dd>Let the mixture cool down a bit. Now pinch out small balls from the mixture and roll them between your hands to make balls.
                 Flatten them just a bit to give the perfect shape of pedas. Use all the mixture to make such pedas.

            </dd>
            <dt><span class=step>Step-6 :</span>Ready to be served
            </dt>
            <dd>Your delicious Besan Pedas are now ready to be served.
